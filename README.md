**This project is archived.** Bito protected their API endpoint some time ago, and I don't want to look into how they did it again. You can still look at the code and do the same with a free Google Gemini API key, so yeah.

## What's this?
**PyAssist** is a simple voice assistant made using OpenAI and Python.
It uses a reverse-engineered Bito.co API to get AI, so there is no need to set an OpenAI key.

## How do I install it?
First, install the necessary dependencies:
```
pip install PyAudio SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
```
Then, download the code to your computer and run the "main.py" file.
If you want to adjust anything, simply change the code.

## How to contribute?
Make a pull request and make sure the code is clean. :)
